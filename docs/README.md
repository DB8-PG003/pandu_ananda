## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Repository Documentation ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Updated README.md with comprehensive project information
- ✅ Added team member details and project goals
- ✅ Included technology stack and development workflow

### 2. Next Steps - GitHub Project Setup
Follow the documentation in order:

1. **Labels**: Use `./scripts/create-labels.sh` to create all required labels
2. **Project Board**: Follow `docs/github-project-setup.md` for project creation
3. **Issues**: Use `docs/issues-template.md` to create all 18 tasks and 3 risks
4. **Timeline**: Reference `docs/project-timeline.md` for scheduling
5. **Validation**: Use `docs/implementation-checklist.md` to track progress

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### Team Structure
- **Flutter Team**: Rangga Rosa (FL2), M. Ridwan Jajilah (FL1)
- **ML Team**: Ardisca Evanandy (ML1), Aurelia Anggit Widyamunika (ML2)

### Sprint Organization
- **4-week project** starting September 10, 2025
- **18 development tasks** across Flutter, ML, and integration work
- **3 high-priority risks** with defined mitigation strategies
- **2 critical dependencies** in the ML-to-mobile pipeline

### Key Deliverables
1. **Week 1**: Foundation setup and data preparation
2. **Week 2**: Core functionality and ML prototype
3. **Week 3**: Dashboard integration and mobile ML setup
4. **Week 4**: Testing, validation, and documentation

## 📊 Project Management Features

### Labels System
- **Sprint tracking**: `sprint: week 1-4`
- **Work categorization**: `type: task`, `type: risk`
- **Priority management**: `priority: high/medium/low`

### Custom Fields
- **Sprint**: Single select (Week 1-4)
- **Estimate**: Text field for day duration
- **Start/Due Dates**: Date fields for timeline tracking

### Project Views
1. **Kanban Board**: Status-based workflow management
2. **Sprint Workload**: Resource allocation by sprint
3. **Project Roadmap**: Timeline visualization with dependencies

## 🔗 Critical Dependencies

```
ML-06 (Convert to TFLite) → K-01 (Define specs) → F-09 (Mobile integration)
```

This dependency chain is critical for mobile ML functionality and requires careful monitoring.

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks
1. **Model Conversion Failure**: TFLite conversion issues
2. **Scope Creep**: Unplanned feature requests
3. **Team Member Absence**: Resource availability risks

Each risk includes detailed mitigation strategies and monitoring plans.

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Definition of Done
Tasks are complete when:
- ✅ Functionality is implemented
- ✅ Code review is passed
- ✅ Integration testing is successful

### Project Success Criteria
- All 18 development tasks completed on schedule
- ML model successfully deployed to mobile
- Parent dashboard provides actionable insights
- Application passes end-to-end testing

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

### Development Stack
